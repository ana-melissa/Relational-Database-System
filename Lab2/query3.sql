-- Query 3

-- A member may have more than one character, 
-- as long as those character roles are different. 
-- Some characters may own things; some characters 
-- may not own any things.

-- Find the name and joinDate of every member 
-- whose joinDate isnâ€™t NULL and who has no 
-- character that owns a thing. (Yes, a member 
-- who has no characters should appear in your 
-- answer.) The attributes in your result should 
-- appear as memberName and memberJoinDate.

-- No duplicates should appear in your result.

-- this query is getting all the currentmembers 
-- who have a character, and that character 
-- doesn't own any things
